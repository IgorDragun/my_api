## MyAPI

### Short description.

It is an **API application** that I developed to improve my understandig of how APIs work in Rails applications.

To understand how this application works, imagine an online platform that includes users and shops. The shops have items. Users can view shops, items for each shop and purchase them. The bought items are then available in the user's inventory. Additionally, users can trade with other users.

This applications is related to https://github.com/IgorDragun/stats_service, which is a service that processes and saves data of bought items separately for each user.
